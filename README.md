I developed an eCommerce website called 'GlamGlab', which is fully responsive.

For the frontend, i utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, BootStrap, and Material UI, React JS, Redux.

 On backend, I employed Node JS, Express JS, and MongoDB.

I used Postman for testing the backend code.

in this Project, I implemented features such as fetching data from the database and displaying it on the browser. Users can click on anyone product to view its details and add it to their cart. They can also select product to sizes and place orders, which are then processed through a payment getway.
