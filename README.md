eCommerce website : GLAMGLAB

I developed **GlamGlab**, a fully responsive eCommerce website designed to provide a seamless shopping experience across all devices.  

### **Frontend Technologies:**  
- **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for the foundational web structure and functionality.  
- **Bootstrap** and **Material UI** for styling and responsiveness.  
- **React JS** and **Redux** for building an efficient and interactive user interface.  

### **Backend Technologies:**  
- **Node JS** and **Express JS** for server-side logic and API creation.  
- **MongoDB** for secure and scalable database management.  

### **Development Tools:**  
- **Postman** for testing and debugging backend APIs.  

### **Key Features:**  
- **Dynamic Product Display:** Fetches product data from the database and displays it on the browser dynamically.  
- **Product Details Page:** Users can click on a product to view detailed information.  
- **Add to Cart Functionality:** Users can add products to their cart and select sizes before checkout.  
- **Order Processing:** Supports placing orders seamlessly with integration to a **payment gateway** for secure transactions.  

> **Note:** The backend server is not deployed for this website. You can check the frontend [[here](https://ecommerce-react-app-frontend.onrender.com)].  

This project highlights a complete workflow, from frontend design to backend development and database integration, offering a real-world shopping platform experience.
